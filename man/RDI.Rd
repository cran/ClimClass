  series,
  clim_norm = NULL,
  first.yr = NULL,
  last.yr = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{series}{series of mean monthly weather values}

\item{clim_norm}{the reference climatic values for each month, used for gap filling. Default is \code{NULL} (no replacement of missing values)}

\item{first.yr}{of the period over which water balance is calculated. Default is  \code{NULL} (calculations start with the first year of the series)}

\item{last.yr}{of the period over which water balance is calculated. Default is  \code{NULL} (calculations start with the last year of the series)}

\item{TAW}{total available water content of soil}

\item{coeff_rad}{vector of solar radiation coefficients (12 values) for calculation of potential evapotranspiration}

\item{coeff_Hargr}{(vector of monthly) correction coefficient(s) for Hargreaves' equation}

\item{quant}{vector of quantiles for the statistical ranking of the year representative for balance (0..1)}
}
\value{
A two-column table reporting Riou's drought indices for each quantile chosen (one line each, minimum is 1). Both "harvest time" and minimum values
are calculated (see details).

\description{
Calculation of Riou's drought index described in OIV bio-climatic indices for viticulture (see references)

\details{
For full description of algorithm see OIV standards at http://www.oiv.int/oiv/info/enresolution2012?lang=en and the references:  Riou, 1994; Tonietto, 1999.
Evapotranspiration is calculated by Hargreaves' equation (see \code{\link{arid}}).

\code{series} is a data frame of the monthly series (means) of: cumulated precipitation (mm), minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature (optional) 
- all in deg. C. Includes the following columns (and names): "year", "month", "P", "Tn", "Tx", "Tm" (optional), for precipitation, minimum, maximum and 
mean temperature, respectively. If \code{Tm} is missing it is calculated as (Tn + Tx)/2. Format is the same of \code{lista_cli}.

\code{clim_norm} is a monthly data frame of 12 climate normals, with the same column names of \code{series}, except "year".
It can be the output of function \code{\link{climate}}. If \code{clim_norm} is not  \code{NULL}, any missing value in 
the monthly series is substituted by the corresponding climatic value in \code{clim_norm}.

A default value of 200 mm for \code{TAW} is suggested by the authors of the index. It can be changed according to the known
pedological features of soil.

\code{coeff_rad} corresponds to the mean monthly extra-atmospheric radiation (see function \code{\link{ExAtRa}}). It is required in Hargreaves' equation.

\code{coeff_Hargr} is either a single value or a vector of 12 coefficients to adjust Hargreaves' estimation of potential evapotranspiration. 
From calibration in 6 stations from the same network of \code{Trent_climate}, its average value is 0.75.

\code{quant_vector} a vector of minimum one element. 0 yields minimum absolute case, 0.5 the median. Values range from 0 to 1 (inappropropriate if > 0.5).

The algorithm described in OIV assesses water balance at the last month of the ripenining period, early autumn. However, in
humid or sub-humid climates the driest period for soil generally falls in summer. For this reason, the output table reports 
both cases ("harvest" time value and monthly minimum over the season, "WB_harv" and "WB_min", respectfully). Harvest time is 
conventionally September (N emisphere) or March (S emisphere).
